# NotesUp App

## About App:

NoteUp is a platform for students where students can Build communities with respect to their schools, colleges, areas, subject, or whatever they want to be. Also, they can share their notes worldwide with others. Basically, it`s a note-sharing platform where you can trade notes. this project is based on several milestones. 

App Architecture/ App Flow
UI/UX
Code

 This app is open-source and open can contribute.

## App Architechture/App Flow:

It is very important to build the Architecture first because it directly impacts application performances and also covers the gaps between loops wholes. According to my opinion, Architecture is the answer to many questions itself such as how your app works, which state management is best for this project, Which type of security we want, which type of database is suitable for this project, how our features are connected, and more. After many tries and covering the all requirements finally i ended up with this.

## UI/UX:

This was a new thing that I learn. It`s wonderful to see how little details create a big impact on our project. There are many things small things which are in hidden relationships with each other such as space between left and right, and font size values between heading paragraphs, and one of the most significant things that change the whole view of how users look at apps is the color palette. Every color palette gives a significant user experience to users. There are a lot of color palettes for apps and lots of variates. For my app I use vibrant colors and here is what I came up with.

## Code:

For me as a programmer here is the loop start 
Code
Eat
Sleep
After putting up 100rs houses and passing thousand of tests finally I come to the result. There are still some bugs in there but they are not major bugs. So we will fix the latter on or maybe the next release.please check the above code and if you feel it valueable then give it a start

Thanks for you intrest!
